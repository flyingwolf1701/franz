Ionic cheatsheet.

\*\*Super uncommon components
<IonApp> --> Can only be used once per application
<IonPage> --> This is only used on a page that is being routed to.

- In our public folder we should have the structure of pages and components.
  <IonHeader> --> This can only be used once per view.
  <IonContent> --> This can also only be used once per view.

\*\* components
<IonToolBox> --> Not entirely sure wtf this does. But it does have top and bottom margin or padding.
<IonTitle> --> I think this adds margin or padding on the left and right.
